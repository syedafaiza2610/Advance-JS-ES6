// write a function which returns array. call the function and destructure array values and print the value

// Make a car object with model, year, color. display all the values by destructuring

// use three variable name, greeting and display value using template literals

// use array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] assign first three values in seperate variables and all remaining in one element as an array

// if car speed is less than 80 display "car speed is slow", if greater than 80 but less than 120 than display

// write a function(arrow function) which takes two values and return its sum as a result

//write a function(arrow function) which takes a number and multiply it with 0.5 and return the new value. print the new value outside the function

//print simple array of [1,2,3,4,5] with the help of array map funtion

// let arr = [{id:1,name:"abc"},{id:1,name:"efg"},{id:2,name:"hij"},{id:3,name:"xyz"}]
// iterate the given array through map function and print the name and id


//We have an array of cities. Assign each city in different individual variable. hint ['LA', 'new york', 'karachi','islamabad']

//We have a student object. Assign each property in different and individual variable in JS {name:'Marry',age:20,rollNo:2}

//A function is taking 5 arguments and You have to pass it through an array.
//let arr = [1,2,3,4,5]

//Given an array of firstname and an array of last name. First check both array size is equal or not, if equal then make third new array which has first last name concat value
//let firstNames = ['maryam', 'hira', 'faiza', 'aisha']
//let lastNames = ['khan', 'ayub', 'aziz', 'yasin']
//['maryam khan', 'hira ayub', 'faiza aziz', 'aisha yasin']

//Create an arrow function that takes array as an input and make each element double and then return an array 

//Create an arrow function that takes a number and return square of a number
